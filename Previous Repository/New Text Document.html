<h1> Remembering Annisul Huq: The man behind the public <i>persona</i> </h1>

"Suchitra will always be Suchitra in my head and never a year beyond 50 at the max."


That said a lot about his own desire to be "forever panting, forever young.<br/>
" For a person who loved life, adda and public life,
 he preferred invisibility when it came to ageing.<br/>
And that's the way he went. 
I made sure that no one saw him in his intubated state, <br/>
and went to great lengths to ensure that his last pictures would be
 of him looking <b>incredibly</b> handsome in a blue kurta or a black suit.
